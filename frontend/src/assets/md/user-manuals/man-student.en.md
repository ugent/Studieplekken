# User manual - Student

Here you will find more information on how to use the Study Rooms application.

## Logging in

If you have not yet logged in, you will see the login button at the top right of the page. If you click on log in, you will be taken to the login page and you will be able to log in via your educational institution. When everything has gone successfully, you will see your name at the top right.

## Searching for a study room

On the main page, you can find all the study locations that can be reserved by you. On this dashboard, you will briefly see some information for each location: including whether it is currently open, how many seats there are and the next free moment for booking. To see more information about this study location, click on 'details'.

## Booking a study location

When you are on the page of a study location, you will see a calendar where you can navigate through the time using the buttons. After choosing a time slot that still has space, you can make a reservation request by selecting the time block and clicking on "Update Reservations" and confirming. Your reservation will then be reviewed, and possibly approved. You may therefore use this location during the entire reservation period once your reservation has been approved. If there is no more space, you will see, for example, 200/200 reservations, which means that all places are occupied.

During the first ten minutes of a reservation period, people can place themselves in a queue. Once these ten minutes are over, seats will then be allocated in a completely random manner to those who have applied. Once these ten minutes are over, the queue will be closed, and reservations will be taken back immediately.

The colour code of the calendar is explained below:
1. If your reservation slot turns dark blue after you click 'update reservations', your reservation has been successful.
2. If your reservation slot turns dark red, your reservation has been refused. Unfortunately, you did not get a seat. Otherwise, this colour does not affect you: we encourage you to try again when space becomes available!
3. If your slot turns light orange, it is pending or in the queue. Please wait until we have reviewed your reservation!
4. If your slot turns light blue, you can make a reservation.
5. If your slot turns light red, it is unfortunately full for the time being.

## Cancel a reservation

If you want to delete reservations, you can do so by selecting a time slot you have already reserved and clicking "update reservation" again. This will show in the dialogue what you are deleting. You can thus add and remove multiple reservations at the same time.

It is also possible to delete reservations via your profile: click on your name at the top right of the page and go to "my reservations". At the bottom of the page you will find an overview of all your reservations. You can cancel a reservation by clicking on the cross in the last column of the table.

## Viewing reservations

To view all your reservations, click on your name at the top right of the page. There you can navigate further to profile. There you can see your own details and an overview of all your reservations.

Here you can also delete your reservations if necessary, by clicking the cross next to your reservation.

## Attendances

When arriving at a study place, attendance will be recorded. This can be done using your student card or the QR code on your profile. Be sure to keep in mind the rules of that location! You can usually find these in the location description.

## Penalty points

Since 10 January 2021, the point system has been in place at Study Rooms. The points system includes several parameters to ensure study places are optimally used, including:

- Late cancellation reservation (<24h): 20 points
- Cancellation of reservation during scanning time: 25 points
- Late cancellation of reservation two days in a row: 50 points
- Failure to show up at study place (including tardiness): 50 points
- Failure to show up/too late at venue two days in a row: 100 points
- Vandalism and debauchery: 150 points

Every student starts with 0 points. From 100 points, you cannot place reservations on the application until the end of the exam period.

## Further questions?

If you have further questions, you can speak to the site administrator or the administrator of your educational institution. They can help you further in each case.
