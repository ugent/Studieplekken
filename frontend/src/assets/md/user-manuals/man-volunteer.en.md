# User guide - supervisor/volunteer

Here you will find all information about the supervisor functionalities of the Study Rooms application. Supervisors are volunteers or staff who will record attendance.

## Attendance recording

After students have registered, it is possible to record their attendance. You do this by clicking on the 'Scan' button at the top right of the navigation bar.

Then click on the location where you need to record attendances.

You can then type in the attendee's first name, last name or student number, or scan in the student's QR code. Students can find their QR code on their profile. For UGent locations, it also always remains possible to scan student cards using a barcode scanner.

## Print list of reservations

It is possible to print a list of placed reservations for a venue. This can then be used to manually tick off attendance, for example.

To do this, first click on scan, then click on the desired location, this is possible from 30 minutes before the time slot starts.

Then scroll down and below the list of enrolled users, click the 'print' button.

Now the print dialogue box will appear, and you can print the list of reservations.

## More questions?

If there are any further questions, please contact the administrator of your location. They will normally be able to help you.
