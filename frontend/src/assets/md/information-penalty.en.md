Since 10 January 2021, the point system applies to the study locations. The point system includes various parameters to ensure that the study places are utilized optimally, including:
Late cancellation of reservation (<24h): 20 points

   - Cancellation of reservation during the scanning moment: 25 points
   - Late cancellation of reservation two days in a row: 50 points
   - Not showing up at the place of study (incl. tardiness): 50 points
   - Not showing up/arriving  to the location two days in a row: 100 points
   - Vandalism and debauchery: 150 points

Every student starts with 0 points. From 100 points onwards, no reservations can be made on the application until the end of the examination period.
